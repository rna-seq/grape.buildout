Grape RNAseq Analysis Pipeline Environment Buildout
===================================================

See the INSTALL.txt file for installation instructions.

See the CHANGES.txt file for differences to previous versions.

High throughput sequencing technologies generate vast amounts of data that 
require subsequent management, analysis and visualization.

The Grape RNAseq Analysis Pipeline Environment implements a set of workflows 
that allow for easy exploration of RNAseq data. Among other features, it 
enables the users to perform

* quality checks
* read mapping
* generation of expression and splicing statistics

The results are stored in a MySQL database and become immediately available
through a RESTful back end server that is connected to a web application using 
the Google chart tools for display.
